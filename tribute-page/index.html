                Lewis was born in the small farming settlement of Freetown,
                Orange County, Virginia,[5] the granddaughter of an emancipated
                slave who helped start the community. She was one of eight
                children. Lewis's father died in 1928 when she was 12, and at 16
                she left Freetown on her own and joined the Great Migration
                north.

              <p>
                When she arrived in New York, an acquaintance found her a job in
                a Brooklyn laundry, where she was assigned to an ironing board.
                She had never ironed and lasted three hours before she was
                dismissed. She had experience in sewing and soon found work as a
                seamstress.

                Café Nicholson and <em>The Taste of Country Cooking</em>
              </h3>
              <p>
                When Lewis left Freetown she moved to Washington, D.C., and
                eventually to New York City in her early 30s.While in New York
                City, Lewis began throwing dinner parties for her friends and
                acquaintances and John Nicholson, an antiques dealer – was one
                of those friends. In 1948 on 58th Street, in East Side
                Manhattan, Nicholson opened Café Nicholson with Lewis as cook,
                which became an instant success among bohemians and artists.
              </p>
              <p>
                The restaurant was frequented by William Faulkner, Marlon
                Brando, Tennessee Williams, Truman Capote, Richard Avedon,
                Gloria Vanderbilt, Marlene Dietrich, Eleanor Roosevelt, and
                Diana Vreeland.[1] At the Café, Lewis served a neat menu of
                simple, Southern inspired dishes, including a chocolate soufflé,
                for which she was known.
              </p>
              <p>
                After five years there, Lewis left Café Nicholson and from there
                she spent time as a pheasant farmer in New Jersey until the
                entire flock died one evening from an unidentified disease. She
                opened and closed her own restaurant, catered for friends and
                acquaintances, taught cooking lessons, and even became a docent
                in the Hall of African Peoples in the American Museum of Natural
                History.

              <p>
                In the late 1960s, she broke her leg and was temporarily forced
                to stop cooking professionally. With encouragement from Judith
                Jones, the cookbook editor at Knopf who also edited Julia Child,
                Evangeline Peterson and Lewis worked together to write The Edna
                Lewis Cookbook (1972). However, Jones found the cookbook
                "fashionable but tasteless" and in turn worked with Lewis on her
                own to write The Taste of Country Cooking in 1976.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Taste of Country Cooking contained as many recipes as it did
                information about Southern and African-American food –
                successfully capturing the spirit and stories Lewis had to share
                – which was Jones' intention with the book. In 1979, Craig
                Claiborne of The New York Times said the book "may well be the
                most entertaining regional cookbook in America".

                After Lewis' husband died, she returned to the restaurant
                business, working at such places as Fearrington House in
                Pittsboro, North Carolina; Middleton Place in Charleston, South
                Carolina; U.S. Steak House in New York City; and the historic
                Gage and Tollner in Brooklyn, New York, where she worked for
                five years before retiring in 1995.[1] In the late 1980s she
                founded the Society for the Revival and Preservation of Southern
                Food – which was a precursor to the Southern Foodways Alliance
                (SFA).

              <p>
                The Society for the Revival and Preservation of Southern Food
                was dedicated in part, to seeing that people did not forget how
                to cook with lard. Throughout the 1990s, she won several awards
                (see below) and befriended a chef named Scott Peacock, after
                meeting him while he was a cook in the Virginia Governor's
                Mansion in 1990.[4] The two formed a deep friendship, with Lewis
                moving to Atlanta to be near Peacock in 1992,[11] and they
                eventually collaborated on the book The Gift of Southern Cooking
                (2003).[4] Their long standing friendship – and seemingly at
                odds personas (he – a young, white, gay male and she – an older,
                widowed African American woman) resulted in them being referred
                to as "The Odd Couple of Southern Cooking".[1] For the rest of
                her life, Lewis and Peacock would work together to try and
                ensure that classic Southern dishes and details would not be
                forgotten – as they were both deeply dedicated to the
                preservation of Southern cooking. As Lewis aged, Peacock would
                go on to become her caretaker up until her death in 2006.
